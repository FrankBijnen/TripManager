# TripManager
Manage the trips on the z&#0361;mo XT(2).

This program has been tested on the XT, and the XT2. Thanks to John Heath and Steve Follen for their work on the XT2.<br>
Starting with Version V1.3.0.147 creating and modifying trips works for the XT2. (Un)grouping does not work for the XT2, but that offers Collections.<br>
